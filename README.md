## Analytics page using pandas and streamlit

**Dependencies** <br>

<ol>
    <li>Pandas</li>
    <li>Streamlit</li>
    <li>Plotly</li>
</ol> <br>

Some streamlit visualization features are limited. Hence, you can maximize the use of **st.plotly_charts**. This is a flexible package in which you can modify more elements in your charts such as background and visualization colors, among others. <br>

This also optimizes the use of **st.markdown** by using custom css inside streamlit.
